Create a simple tic-tac-toe game. Depending on your skills and knowledge.
Game grid should be 3x3. It should be possible for the user to put values in the grid by typing row number and column number.

Easy: Ask user for row and column and write in the two dimensional array a value "1" in the correct place.
Check whether or not the row chosen by user contains all 1.
If all elements in row contain 1, then let player know they won.

Medium: Ask for row and column and write in the two dimensional array a value "1" or "2" in the correct place, depending on which players turn it is. Switch the turn after every move.
Check whether or not the row chosen by user contains all 1, or all 2.
Check whether or not the column chosen by user contains all 1, or all 2.
(1 represents X, 2 represents O, 0 represents empty)

Hard: A regular tic-tac-toe, check diagonals as well. Instead of 1 and 0, use X and O (2D array should be of char type.)
After every move make sure the playing field is not full and make it draw, if it is full.
